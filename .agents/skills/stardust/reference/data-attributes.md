# Structural data attributes

A small vocabulary of `data-*` attributes that stardust applies to
section-level elements in every prototype and migrated page. The
vocabulary is the *structural lingua franca* between stardust's
sub-commands, between stardust and downstream tools (a future EDS
skill, a static-site analyser, an audit script), and between two runs
of stardust on the same site.

Carried from stardust v1 (wireframe-guide.md) unchanged.

## Why

Three reasons:

1. **Migration round-trips.** When `migrate` re-renders a page from
   the current state against an updated DESIGN.md, it needs to map
   sections of the old structure to sections of the new structure. The
   data attributes provide stable identity across renders without
   relying on class names (which change with the design).
2. **Critique and audit.** `$impeccable critique` and `$impeccable
   audit` give better feedback when section purpose is explicit. A
   `data-intent="emotional hook"` tells the critic what the section is
   for, not just what it looks like.
3. **Downstream consumers.** A future `aem-eds-from-stardust` skill
   (out of scope here) will map sections to EDS blocks. The data
   attributes are the contract that lets a separate plugin ingest
   stardust's output without re-parsing semantics.

## Where they go

On `<section>` elements (or the equivalent landmark element) inside
`<main>`, header, and footer. Not on every div. The granularity is
"section the user can describe in one phrase" — a hero, a feature
list, a social-proof strip, a footer block.

## Required attributes

Every section gets these three:

- **`data-section`** — descriptive name. Natural language slug, not a
  framework block name. Examples: `"hero"`, `"features"`,
  `"social-proof"`, `"recipe-showcase"`, `"closing-cta"`,
  `"contact-form"`, `"footer-nav"`. Lowercase kebab-case.
- **`data-intent`** — why this section exists. Examples: `"emotional
  hook"`, `"value proposition"`, `"build trust"`, `"drive action"`,
  `"explain mechanic"`, `"capture lead"`. Whole phrases allowed.
- **`data-layout`** — spatial hint. One of: `"full-bleed"`,
  `"contained"`, `"split-media"`, `"grid"`, `"stack"`, `"side-rail"`,
  `"edge-to-edge"`. Open-ended; new values are fine if the section
  doesn't fit.

## Optional attributes

Add when relevant; omit otherwise:

- **`data-items`** — number of repeated items in the section (cards,
  features, testimonials, pricing tiers). Use a number, not a range.
- **`data-media`** — media type carried by the section. Values:
  `"image"`, `"video"`, `"animation"`, `"none"`.
- **`data-interactive`** — interaction the section supports. Values:
  `"carousel"`, `"filter"`, `"calculator"`, `"tabs"`, `"accordion"`,
  `"form"`. One value per section; if multiple apply, pick the
  dominant one.

## Multi-page fragment attributes

For sites with content that appears on multiple pages (recipe cards
shown on the recipe index and the home page; testimonial cards shown
on the about page and the pricing page), use the fragment trio:

- **`data-fragment`** — fragment type identifier. Examples:
  `"recipe-card"`, `"testimonial-card"`, `"capability-highlight"`.
- **`data-fragment-role`** — `"source"` (this is the canonical home
  of the fragment) or `"reuse"` (this is a consuming page).
- **`data-fragment-source`** — path to the source page. Only on
  `reuse` sections. Example: `"/recipes"`.

The fragment vocabulary is the contract between stardust and a
future shared-component extractor: pages with `data-fragment-role="source"`
become the components, pages with `data-fragment-role="reuse"`
become consumers.

## Template, module, and slot vocabulary

Page-level identity, module-instance identity, and content-slot
identity. Added with the migrate-template-canon refactor (see
`notes/migrate-template-canon-refactor.md`). These are the contract
`migrate` consumes when forking an approved template's structure
across sibling pages, and the contract downstream conversion plugins
(EDS, CMS, framework) consume to rewrite stardust's HTML
mechanically rather than re-deriving structure.

### Page-level

- **`data-template`** — the page's type. Mirrors the `type` field on
  the page entry in `state.json`. Lives on `<body>` or `<main>`.
  Values mirror the type catalog (`landing`, `article`, `listing`,
  `program`, `form`, `static`, `unique`, plus any per-site
  additions).

### Module-instance

- **`data-module`** — module identifier matching an entry in
  `DESIGN.json.extensions.modules[]`. Lives on the module's root
  element. Examples: `"hotline-211"`, `"donate-band"`,
  `"story-card"`.

### Slot identity

- **`data-slot`** — slot name within the nearest enclosing
  `data-template` or `data-module`. Locally scoped — `<div
  data-module="hotline-211"><span data-slot="phone">211</span></div>`
  reads as "the `phone` slot of the `hotline-211` module."

  Slot vocabulary is per-template and per-module, declared in
  catalog entries. Slots mark **containers of identifiable content
  units**, not arbitrary leaf nodes — `data-slot="article-body"`
  goes on the prose container, not on every paragraph inside it.

- **`data-bespoke`** — flag (no value) on a slot not in the
  template/module catalog. The slot is one-off for this instance,
  logged in the page's `migrationDecisions[]`, and counted toward
  the auto-promotion threshold (3 instances → `migrate` suggests
  promotion to canonical).

### Canon and deviation markers

- **`data-canon`** — flag (no value) on a chrome container (header,
  footer, nav, global banner) lifted verbatim from
  `stardust/canon/`. Tells downstream consumers: preserve verbatim,
  do not re-style, do not let template-specific treatments
  override.

- **`data-deviation="<reason>"`** — on a chrome or canon-derived
  element deliberately changed for this template. Reason is a
  short human-readable phrase (e.g., `"sticky reading-progress
  bar for long-form"`). Mirrored as a `canon-deviation` entry in
  the page's `migrationDecisions[]`.

### Broken-link marker

- **`data-broken-link="true"`** — on `<a href>` whose same-host
  target slug is not in the migrated inventory. Surfaced in
  `migrate`'s run summary; user resolves by extracting the
  missing page and re-migrating, or accepts the broken link.

### Mobile-collapse marker

- **`data-nav-collapse="hamburger"`** — on `<header>` when the
  stock mobile-nav collapse pattern is applied during Phase 2.7
  (`skills/prototype/SKILL.md` § Mobile-adapt audit /
  `skills/prototype/reference/mobile-nav-collapse.md`).
  Downstream consumers detect the marker to avoid re-applying or
  re-checking the same collapse — the Mobile-adapt audit, the
  migrate re-derivation, and any future shared-component
  extractor read it as "this header already collapses; pass
  through verbatim."

  Possible values: `"hamburger"` (the stocked stock pattern). Future
  values may include `"priority-overflow"`, `"bottom-nav"`,
  `"drawer"` if those alternatives gain stock treatments; today
  the agent does not auto-apply them and therefore does not write
  the marker.

  Absent on headers that already fit at 360px without a collapse
  (e.g. a 2-link nav at desktop type sizes).

## Examples

```html
<section data-section="hero"
         data-intent="emotional hook"
         data-layout="full-bleed"
         data-media="image">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>

<section data-section="features"
         data-intent="value proposition"
         data-layout="grid"
         data-items="3">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>

<section data-section="recipe-grid"
         data-intent="discovery"
         data-layout="grid"
         data-fragment="recipe-card"
         data-fragment-role="source"
         data-items="12">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>

<section data-section="recipe-teaser"
         data-intent="cross-link"
         data-layout="grid"
         data-fragment="recipe-card"
         data-fragment-role="reuse"
         data-fragment-source="/recipes"
         data-items="3">
  <!-- ... -->
</section>
```

## Who reads, who writes

- **`prototype`** writes them on every section of the proposed
  redesign HTML. The `purpose` heuristic from
  `extract/reference/current-state-schema.md` § Landmarks seeds the
  initial values; the `craft` step refines them.
- **`migrate`** preserves them on every section of the final
  redesigned HTML. When migrating from the proposed prototype, the
  attributes are passed through verbatim. When the structure changes
  during migration, the agent updates `data-section` / `data-intent`
  to match and notes the change in the migration log.
- **`extract`** infers `data-section` and `data-intent` for current-state
  pages (per the `purpose` heuristic) but does **not** add them to the
  per-page JSON's source HTML capture — they are stardust's output
  vocabulary, not an input description.
- A downstream EDS skill (out of scope) reads them from migrated
  pages to map sections to blocks. The template/module/slot
  vocabulary is the load-bearing surface for that conversion:
  `data-template` maps to a page template, `data-module` to a
  block, `data-slot` to a block-cell, and `data-canon` to
  verbatim-chrome regions.

## What this vocabulary is **not**

- It is not a CSS naming convention. Class names belong to the design
  system. Data attributes belong to stardust's structural model.
- It is not a framework block taxonomy. EDS blocks, MDX components,
  and React components have their own names; the agent maps from
  `data-section` to those names downstream.
- It is not a critique or score. `data-intent` describes purpose; it
  does not judge whether the purpose is fulfilled.

## Versioning

The vocabulary version is implicit in the stardust version.

**v2 base set.** `data-section`, `data-intent`, `data-layout`,
`data-items`, `data-media`, `data-interactive`, `data-fragment`,
`data-fragment-role`, `data-fragment-source` — ship with stardust
v0.2.0.

**v2.1 additive set.** `data-template`, `data-module`, `data-slot`,
`data-bespoke`, `data-canon`, `data-deviation`, `data-broken-link`
— ship with the migrate-template-canon refactor. Additive: every
v2-only consumer continues to work; v2.1-aware consumers gain the
template/module/slot/canon surface.

**v2.2 additive set.** `data-nav-collapse` — ships with the
mobile-nav-collapse pattern (`reference/mobile-nav-collapse.md`).
Additive on `<header>`; absent for headers that didn't need a
collapse.

New attributes can be added in a backward-compatible way; renaming
existing ones requires a version bump.
