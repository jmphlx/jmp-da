# Artifact map

Every file stardust reads or writes, who owns it, what it contains, and
how its provenance block is shaped.

---

## Project root (impeccable's format — stardust authors directly)

| Path             | Format owner | Stardust writes when                                         | Stardust reads when                    |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `PRODUCT.md`     | impeccable   | `$stardust direct` authors it from the resolved direction    | every sub-command (target strategy)    |
| `DESIGN.md`      | impeccable   | `$stardust direct` authors it from the resolved direction + brand surface | `prototype`, `migrate`     |
| `DESIGN.json`    | impeccable   | `$stardust direct` authors it from the resolved direction + brand surface | `prototype`, `migrate`     |
| `AGENTS.md`      | impeccable   | never (read-only for stardust)                               | every sub-command (Design Context)     |

Stardust authors `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `DESIGN.json` **directly**,
treating impeccable's `reference/teach.md` and `reference/document.md` as
**format specs** rather than runtime commands. Reasoning: by the time
`$stardust direct` runs, the user has already gone through stardust's
intent-reasoning interview — re-running impeccable's interview would
duplicate questions. The resolved direction in `stardust/direction.md`
carries every answer impeccable's interviews would surface.

Users who want impeccable to validate or refine the project-root files
can run `$impeccable teach` or `$impeccable document` directly at any
time; stardust does not own those commands and will not interfere.

The same direct-authoring pattern is used for the descriptive files
under `stardust/current/` written by `$stardust extract`.

### `DESIGN.json.extensions`

The `extensions` object grows with the migrate-template-canon
refactor (see `notes/migrate-template-canon-refactor.md`):

- **`extensions.canon`** — pinned token values, compositional moves
  (free-text), and references to `stardust/canon/*` chrome and CSS
  files (`{ path, sha }` per file). Written by `$stardust prototype
  --prep` on first approval; extended on subsequent approvals.
- **`extensions.modules[]`** — brand module catalog: `id`, `slots`
  (with `name`, `type`, `required`, optional `default`),
  `canonicalRendering` reference. Auto-detected during `$stardust
  extract --prep`; promoted/refined during `$stardust direct
  --prep`.
- **`extensions.colorReservations[]`** — colors reserved to specific
  modules or contexts (e.g., centennial-red reserved to a
  `trh-100-lockup` module). Validated at migrate time; violation
  refuses the page.
- **`extensions.metadata`** — site-level metadata defaults: site
  name, default OG image, theme color, organization JSON-LD,
  default locale. Composed with per-page metadata at migrate time.

```

The migrated tree is a **self-contained, zip-and-deploy** bundle.
Contract in `skills/stardust/reference/migrate-output-format.md`;
the `state.json.migrate` block (with `selfContained: true`) is the
forward-compat signal downstream consumers test for.

### `stardust/state.json`
Owner: every stardust sub-command. Schema in `state-machine.md`.

### `stardust/direction.md`
Owner: `$stardust direct`. The full reasoning trace for the resolved
direction, written using the format in
`skills/direct/reference/direction-format.md`. The agent appends a new
section every time direction changes.

### `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md` and `DESIGN.md`
Owner: `$stardust extract`. Authored by `$impeccable teach` /
`$impeccable document` against the extracted site, but seeded by
stardust. These files describe what *is*, not what *should be*.

### `stardust/current/brand-review.html`
Owner: `$stardust extract` (Phase 5). Self-contained visual review of
the extraction — the **first eyeball-able artifact** the pipeline
emits. Renders the canonical brand-board section contract plus a
Tensions section that surfaces forced decisions for `direct`. Format
spec in `skills/extract/reference/brand-review-template.md`. Embedded
CSS only, no external JavaScript, rendered in the brand's own
captured colors and fonts.

The reviewer is expected to open this file and confirm the extraction
captured the site faithfully **before** running `$stardust direct`.
Misreads caught here are cheap to fix (re-run extract); misreads
caught after `direct` are not.

### `stardust/current/_brand-extraction.json`
Owner: `$stardust extract` (Phase 3). Consolidated brand surface —
palette, type, motifs, system components, voice, register. Schema in
`skills/extract/reference/brand-surface.md`.

### `stardust/current/_crawl-log.json`
Owner: `$stardust extract` (Phases 1, 2, 6). Append-only audit trail
of discovery and crawl. Re-running extract appends to `runs[]` rather
than overwriting. Schema in
`skills/extract/reference/ia-extraction.md` § `_crawl-log.json` shape.

### `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.json`
Owner: `$stardust extract`. Per-page parsed model. Schema lives in
`skills/extract/reference/current-state-schema.md` (Phase 1).

### `stardust/current/assets/`
Owner: `$stardust extract`. Logo + media extracted from the live site.
Filenames preserve the source basename plus a hash to avoid collisions.

### `stardust/prototypes/<slug>-shape.md`
Owner: `$stardust prototype` (Phase 1). Per-page compositional
brief. Carries page-level deployment decisions: section order,
layout strategy, key states, interaction model, structural data
attributes, unsourced-content list. Format spec in
`skills/prototype/reference/page-shape-brief.md`.

The brief exists because of the site/page split (see the
site-level vs page-level table below). `direct` authors the
design **system**; the brief records the **deployment** of that
system to a specific page. A direction change invalidates the
system; the brief is content-aware-stale only when the system
change makes its composition impossible.

### `stardust/prototypes/<slug>-proposed.html`
Owner: `$stardust prototype`. One file per page — the **proposed
redesign on its own**: self-contained, complete HTML page rendered
against the target `DESIGN.md`. The user opens it in the browser to
review; chat-driven impeccable commands iterate on it; `$stardust
migrate` later re-derives from it for the final migrated page. Full
contract in `skills/prototype/reference/proposed-file-shell.md`.

The file carries a provenance block in `<head>` listing the active
direction it was rendered against; when direction changes the page
is flagged `stale` in `state.json` and re-runs of `prototype` skip
it unless `--all` is passed.

### `stardust/migrated/`
Owner: `$stardust migrate`. A deployable static HTML site. The slug →
output-path mapping (`home` → `index.html`, `pricing` →
`pricing/index.html`, `docs__api` → `docs/api/index.html`) is detailed
in `skills/migrate/reference/migration-procedure.md` § Output path
mapping.

Each page is a self-contained HTML file with a stardust:migrate
provenance block as the first child of `<head>`, the `:root` block
exposing the current DESIGN.md tokens, structural data attributes on
every section, and asset references rewritten to root-relative
paths of the form `/assets/<subpath>` (per
`skills/migrate/reference/asset-bundling.md`). The full bundle —
HTML + every referenced asset — is self-contained: `cd
stardust/migrated && zip -r out.zip .` produces a deploy-ready
archive.

The migrated tree is **incremental and idempotent**. Re-running
migrate writes only pages whose source has changed (sha-compared in
provenance). Migration is per-page — the user can migrate part of
the site today and the rest later.

### `stardust/canon/`
Owner: `$stardust prototype --prep`. Written on first prototype
approval (typically the home; `--canon-from <slug>` overrides),
extended on subsequent approvals. Contains the design canon — the
load-bearing visual decisions extracted from approved prototypes
that govern every other template's rendering.

- **`header.html` / `footer.html`** — chrome HTML lifted verbatim
  from the canon-author prototype. Other templates inject these
  files into their proposed and migrated output.
- **`canon.css`** — compound CSS for the named visual language
  (`.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.card`, `.link`, form
  inputs). Consumes DESIGN.md tokens; injected into every migrated
  page's `<style>` block alongside `:root`.
- **`modules/<module-id>.html`** — canonical rendering per brand
  module. Each file's path + sha is referenced by
  `DESIGN.json.extensions.modules[].canonicalRendering`.

Pinned token values, compositional moves, and conflict-resolution
metadata live inside `DESIGN.json.extensions.canon` rather than as
standalone files. Canon-extraction procedure:
`skills/prototype/reference/canon-extraction.md`.

### `stardust/migrated/<slug-path>/_meta.json`
Owner: `$stardust migrate`. Sidecar JSON written alongside every
migrated `index.html` — one for the home at `migrated/_meta.json`,
one per nested slug at `migrated/<slug-path>/_meta.json`. Carries:

- Resolved metadata (system-fixed, brand-level, preserved, derived).
- Resolved JSON-LD (when page-type is known).
- Filled slot list and module-instance list.
- The `migrationDecisions[]` array — per-page reasoning trace
  (`template-applied` / `template-adapted` / `unique-render` /
  `module-bespoke-slot` / `canon-deviation` / `metadata-override`).
- Canon shas at the time of migration (so re-runs detect canon
  drift).

The HTML `<head>` provenance block stays compact; the sidecar
carries the full trace. Both are redundant on purpose — downstream
consumers can read either source.

## Provenance shapes

Stardust uses three provenance shapes depending on the file type, the
same convention as v1 and as impeccable's loader expects.

### HTML files
First child of `<head>`:

```html
<!-- stardust:provenance
  writtenBy:        stardust:prototype
  writtenAt:        2026-04-25T15:42:00Z
  againstDirection: stardust/direction.md#section-2
  readArtifacts:
    - stardust/current/pages/home.json
    - DESIGN.md
    - DESIGN.json
  synthesizedInputs: []
  stardustVersion:  0.2.0
-->
```

### Markdown files
First line, before any frontmatter:

```markdown
<!-- stardust:provenance
  writtenBy: stardust:direct
  writtenAt: 2026-04-25T14:10:00Z
  ...
-->
---
```

### JSON files
First top-level key (`_provenance`):

```json
{
  "_provenance": {
    "writtenBy": "stardust:extract",
    "writtenAt": "2026-04-25T13:00:00Z",
    "readArtifacts": ["https://example.com/"],
    "synthesizedInputs": [],
    "stardustVersion": "0.2.0"
  },
  "...": "..."
}
```

## Site-level vs page-level

Stardust separates **system** (site-wide design decisions) from
**deployment** (how the system applies to a specific page). The
boundary lives between `direct`'s outputs and `prototype`'s
outputs, not within either:

| concern | lives in (site-level) | lives in (page-level) |
|---|---|---|
| Token vocabulary (colors, typography, spacing, radii) | `DESIGN.md` frontmatter | — |
| Voice rules, hard rules, anti-references, tone exemplars | `DESIGN.md` § 6 + `DESIGN.json` `narrative.rules/dos/donts` | — |
| Anti-toolbox audit, divergence trace | `DESIGN.json` `extensions.divergence` | — |
| Abstract component vocabulary (button-primary, card, input — default treatment, no per-page values) | `DESIGN.json` `extensions.componentStyle` + top-level `components[]` | — |
| Named system-component **roles** (header / footer / cta-band / etc. — purpose + position class) | `DESIGN.json` `extensions.systemComponentRoles` | — |
| Per-page section list and order | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Sections |
| Per-page layout strategy (column ratios, alternation, breakpoint inversions) | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Layout strategy |
| Literal copy per section | — | sourced from `current/pages/<slug>.json` into `<slug>-shape.md` |
| Section-level pixel dimensions, dock points, viewport-specific widths | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Layout strategy |
| Stat numbers, addresses, phones, quotes, named persons | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Sections OR `<slug>-shape.md` § Unsourced content (placeholder) |
| System-component **deployment** (literal tile labels, link targets, copy variants) | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Sections |
| Per-page interaction model (CSS-only details/target panels, etc.) | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Interaction model |
| Per-page key states (default/empty/loading/error) | — | `<slug>-shape.md` § Key states |

**Rule of thumb:** if removing a value from the file would make
the file nonsensical for *every other page on the site*, it's
site-level (DESIGN.md). If removing it would only affect *this
page*, it's page-level (`<slug>-shape.md`).

The split solves three problems with a prior mash-up where both
lived in DESIGN.md:

1. **DESIGN.md grew per-page** — each prototyped page leaked its
   specifics into the site spec. Now DESIGN.md size is bounded
   by the system, not the page count.
2. **Direct over-specified the visual layer at site-time** —
   leaving prototype no room to diverge per-page. Now prototype
   owns deployment; direct owns vocabulary.
3. **Re-direct ambiguity** — was the user changing the system
   (tokens, voice) or the deployment (composition on this page)?
   Now direct's edits target the system; prototype's edits target
   a single brief; stale-flagging is content-aware per
   `state-machine.md` § Stale flagging.

When in doubt about where a new piece of information should land,
ask: does this affect *every* page in the inventory, or just one?
The answer locates the file.

## Read-vs-write discipline

- **Read order** for any sub-command: `state.json` first, then
  `direction.md`, then the impeccable target files at the project root,
  then anything from `stardust/current/` it specifically needs.
- **Write order** for any sub-command: write all artifacts first, then
  update `state.json` last. If a write fails, the `state.json` update
  is skipped so the next run sees a consistent prior state.
- **Provenance is mandatory.** Any artifact without a provenance block
  is treated as user-edited and stardust will not silently overwrite it.
  When stardust detects a provenance-less artifact in a path it owns,
  it asks the user before proceeding.
