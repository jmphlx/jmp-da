# AEM Workflow Debugging — Cloud Service

Production-grade debugging for AEM Granite Workflow engine, launcher, Inbox, Sling Jobs, thread pools, and purge on **AEM as a Cloud Service**.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is **cloud-service-only**.
- No JMX access — use Developer Console, Cloud Manager logs, custom HTTP APIs.
- Config changes require code in Git and Cloud Manager pipeline deploy.

---

## When to use this skill

- Workflow stuck, not progressing, failed, not starting, task not in Inbox, purge/repository bloat, permissions, queue backlog, thread pool exhaustion, auto-advancement not working.
- User provides thread dumps, Sling Job console output, or error.log excerpts from Cloud Manager.
- Environment: AEM as a Cloud Service (no JMX; use Developer Console, Cloud Manager logs).

## Step 1: Map symptom to runbook

| Symptom | symptom_id | Runbook | First action |
|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| Workflow stuck (not advancing) | workflow_stuck_not_progressing | runbook-workflow-stuck.md | Open instance; note current step type. No work item → stale. |
| Task not in Inbox | task_not_in_inbox | runbook-task-not-in-inbox.md | Confirm Participant step; assignee = logged-in user; Inbox filters. |
| Workflow not starting (launcher) | workflow_not_starting_launcher | runbook-launcher-not-starting.md | Launcher enabled; path/event match payload. |
| Workflow fails or shows error | workflow_fails_or_shows_error | runbook-workflow-fails-or-shows-error.md | Instance history; error.log for instance ID; payload and process. |
| Step failed, retries exhausted | step_failed_retries_exhausted | runbook-failed-work-items.md | Logs → process.label → Inbox retry. |
| Stale (no current work item) | stale_workflow_no_work_item | runbook-stale-workflows.md | Custom API/script to detect and restart stale workflows. |
| Repository bloat / too many instances | repository_bloat_too_many_instances | runbook-purge-and-cleanup.md | Purge Scheduler configuration. |
| User cannot see or complete item | user_cannot_see_or_complete_item | runbook-inbox-and-permissions.md | Assignee/initiator/superuser; enforce flags. |
| Cannot delete model | cannot_delete_model | runbook-model-delete-and-update.md | Count running workflows → terminate → delete. |
| Slow throughput / queue backlog | slow_throughput_queue_backlog | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md | Sling Job statistics; max.procs; Sling thread pool. |
| Auto-advancement not working | workflow_auto_advance_failure | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md | Check `default` thread pool saturation; Sling Scheduler; timeout jobs. |
| New workflow not working | workflow_setup_validation | runbook-validate-workflow-setup.md | Model sync, launcher, process registration, permissions. |

---

## Step 2: Decision tree (workflow stuck)

1. **No current work item?** → Stale. Use custom API/script to detect and restart stale workflows.
2. **Participant step** → Assignee exists? Inbox visible? Payload accessible? Dynamic participant resolver returning correct user?
3. **Process step** → Search error.log for instance ID. Check: `process.label` registered, payload path exists, bundle active, no exception in `execute()`.
4. **OR/AND Split** → Condition evaluates correctly? Routes exist? No dead-end branches? Model synced?

---

## Step 3: Thread dump & thread pool analysis

Thread dumps on Cloud Service are obtained via **Developer Console** or by requesting from support. Configuration output may also need to be requested from support.

### 3a. Sling `default` thread pool (critical path)

The Sling Scheduler `ApacheSlingdefault` uses `ThreadPool: default`. This pool fires:
- `com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job` (auto-advancement)
- Oak observation events
- All Quartz-scheduled jobs

**Check in thread pool output:**

| Field | Healthy | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| active count | < max pool size | **= max pool size** (saturated) |
| block policy | RUN | **ABORT** (rejects tasks when full) |
| max pool size | ≥ 20 | Low values starve schedulers |

**If active count = max pool size AND block policy = ABORT:**
- New scheduled tasks (including workflow timeout/auto-advance jobs) are **silently rejected**
- This is the #1 cause of auto-advancement failure

**Check in thread dump:**
- Search for `sling-default-` threads
- If all threads show same stack (e.g. stuck on HTTP call, database, or external service), that's the blocking culprit
- Note `elapsed` time — threads stuck for hours indicate a hung external call without timeout

### 3b. Sling Job thread pool

**Check `Apache Sling Job Thread Pool`:**
- active count vs max pool size
- If saturated, Sling Jobs cannot execute (workflow jobs stall)

### 3c. Granite Workflow Queue

**Check Sling Jobs output:**

| Field | Healthy | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Queued Jobs (overall) | 0 | > 0 (jobs waiting) |
| Failed Jobs | 0 | > 0 (step failures) |
| Active Jobs | 0-N | 0 when Queued > 0 (jobs not picked up) |

**Check topic statistics for workflow model:**
- Topic: `com/adobe/granite/workflow/job/var/workflow/models/<modelName>`
- High `Failed Jobs` / low `Finished Jobs` ratio → process step throwing exceptions

**Check Granite Workflow Queue configuration:**
- Type: Topic Round Robin
- Max Parallel: 1 (default; consider increasing for throughput)
- Max Retries: 10

### 3d. Sling Scheduler

**Check Sling Scheduler output:**
- Verify `com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job` scheduled jobs exist
- `nextFireTime: null` → job already fired or deregistered
- Verify which ThreadPool the scheduler uses (should be `default`)

## Step 4: Error log patterns

Download error.log from **Cloud Manager** → Environments → Logs, or use log streaming.

| Pattern | Cause | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `Error executing workflow step` | Process step exception | Check stack; fix process code or payload |
| `getProcess for '<name>' failed` | No WorkflowProcess registered | Deploy bundle; match `process.label` |
| `Cannot archive workitem` | Archive failure → stale risk | Detect and restart stale workflows |
| `refreshing the session since we had to wait for a lock` | Lock contention | Increase `cq.workflow.job.max.procs` via config in Git |
| `Terminate failed` / `Resume failed` / `Suspend failed` | Permissions (not initiator/superuser) | Check `enforceWorkflowInitiatorPermissions`; add to superusers |
| `PathNotFoundException` (workflow/payload) | Payload/launcher path missing | Verify payload exists; check launcher config path |
| `Error adding launcher config` | Launcher config path not created | Create `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config` |
| `retrys exceeded - remove isTransient` | Transient workflow failed after retries | Fix process code; instance persisted for admin handling |
| `RejectedExecutionException` | Thread pool full with ABORT policy | Increase pool size or change policy to RUN via config; fix stuck threads |
| `Workflow is already finished` | Terminate on completed/aborted instance | Check logic calling terminate |
| `Workflow purge '<name>' : repository exception` | Purge JCR error | Check permissions; repo health |

---

## Step 5: Configuration checklist

Config changes on Cloud Service require OSGi config files in the Git repository, deployed via Cloud Manager pipeline.

| Config | Property | Check |
|--------|----------|-------|
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `cq.workflow.job.retry` | Default 3; increase for flaky steps |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `cq.workflow.job.max.procs` | -1 = CPU cores; increase for throughput |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `granite.workflow.enforceWorkitemAssigneePermissions` | true = only assignee sees items |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `granite.workflow.enforceWorkflowInitiatorPermissions` | true = only initiator can terminate |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `cq.workflow.superuser` | Must include admin users/groups |
| DefaultThreadPool (default) | `block policy` | ABORT can reject timeout jobs; prefer RUN |
| DefaultThreadPool (default) | `max pool size` | 20 default; increase if many schedulers |
| Granite Workflow Queue | Max Parallel | 1 default; increase for throughput |
| Purge Scheduler | `scheduledpurge.daysold` | 30 default; tune per environment |

---

## Step 6: Remediation quick reference

| Action | Cloud Service approach |
|--------|----------------------|
| Retry failed work item | Inbox Retry; no JMX available |
| Restart stale workflows | Custom API/script; no JMX available |
| Purge completed | Purge Scheduler (OSGi config in Git) |
| Increase parallelism | Config in Git: `cq.workflow.job.max.procs`; deploy via pipeline |
| Fix thread pool exhaustion | Restart instance (immediate); fix stuck scheduler code; change block policy to RUN via config |
| Fix process not found | Deploy bundle; `process.label` must match; Sync model |
| Fix auto-advancement | Verify `default` pool not saturated; timeout jobs scheduled; block policy = RUN |

---

## Step 7: Common root cause patterns (from real incidents)

### Pattern A: Thread pool starvation → auto-advance failure

**Symptom:** Workflow auto-advancement stops; timeout jobs not firing; workflows stuck at participant step despite timeout configured.

**Root cause chain:**
1. Custom scheduler makes blocking HTTP call without timeout
2. `concurrent = true` allows overlapping executions on each cron trigger
3. Each stuck execution consumes a `default` pool thread indefinitely
4. All 20 threads consumed → pool saturated
5. Block policy = ABORT → new Quartz jobs rejected silently
6. Workflow timeout jobs (`com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job`) cannot fire
7. Auto-advancement never happens

**Diagnosis checklist:**
- [ ] Thread pool output: Pool `default` → active count = max pool size?
- [ ] Thread pool output: Pool `default` → block policy = ABORT?
- [ ] Thread dump: All `sling-default-*` threads stuck on same stack?
- [ ] Sling Jobs output: Workflow job topic has high Failed Jobs?
- [ ] Sling Scheduler output: ThreadPool = `default` for `ApacheSlingdefault`?

**Fix:** Restart instance (immediate); fix scheduler code (add HTTP timeout, set `concurrent=false`); change pool policy to RUN; increase pool size. All config changes via Git + pipeline.

### Pattern B: High workflow job failure rate

**Symptom:** `numberOfFailedJobs` >> `numberOfFinishedJobs` for a workflow topic.

**Root cause:** Process step exception, payload deleted, or process not registered.

**Diagnosis:** Search error.log (from Cloud Manager) for `Error executing workflow step` + model name. Check `process.label` in OSGi components.

### Pattern C: Stale workflows accumulating

**Symptom:** Workflows in RUNNING state but no work items; Inbox empty despite running instances.

**Root cause:** `Cannot archive workitem` during transition; JCR session crash during step completion.

**Diagnosis:** Search for `Cannot archive workitem` in Cloud Manager logs; use custom API to count stale workflows.
