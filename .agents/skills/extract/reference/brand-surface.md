# Brand surface

The shape of `stardust/current/_brand-extraction.json` and the
procedure that produces it. Run once per `extract` invocation, **after
Phase 2 has finished** so cross-page aggregation has data to work with.

Some fields are sourced from the home page only (logo, voice samples,
hero-specific copy). Others must be aggregated across **all extracted
pages** to avoid the home-page bias documented in § Aggregation scope.

The brand surface is the descriptive ground truth for **what the
existing site looks and feels like at the brand level**. It is the
input both to direct authoring of `stardust/current/PRODUCT.md` and
`DESIGN.md` (Phase 4 of `extract`) and to the `direct` sub-command
when it later reasons about how far to move from the current brand.

Stardust **does not invent** brand-surface values. Every value is
either captured directly from the page or aggregated from captured
values, and carries a source citation.

## § Aggregation scope

Each field below is sourced from one of two scopes:

| scope | fields | rationale |
|---|---|---|
| home-only | `logo`, `voice.heroHeadline`, `voice.heroSubcopy`, `voice.primaryCTALabel`, `voice.firstParagraph`, `register` | These are the landing surface; aggregating across pages would dilute, not clarify |
| cross-page | `palette`, `type` (sizes, weights, families used), `spacing`, `motifs.borderRadius`, `motifs.shadows`, `motifs.gradients`, `componentStyle`, `voice.ctaSamples`, `voice.navItems`, `voice.footerHeadings` | Home-only readings are biased by hero/CTA-heavy markup; the dominant motif on the site as a whole is what `direct` needs |

Cross-page aggregation rules:

1. Read every `stardust/current/pages/<slug>.json` produced in Phase 2.
2. For each numeric/categorical value (border-radius, shadow string,
   font-size, padding, etc.), build a frequency table weighted by
   element count, **not** page count — so a page with 30 cards
   contributes 30 radii, not 1.
3. Pick the mode (most frequent) as the `primary` value; second mode
   as `secondary`; pill-radius (≥9999px or ≥50% on a square element)
   captured separately as `pill` if present.
4. For each captured value, record the top 3 source pages in
   `sources` so the agent can verify and `direct` can reason about
   "where this motif lives."

If a field's mode-on-home and mode-cross-page disagree, prefer the
cross-page value and surface the divergence in `_provenance.notes`
(e.g. `"home suggested borderRadius=150px (pill, buttons-only); cross-page mode is 3px (cards/inputs/chips, 122 occurrences)"`).
This divergence note is the single most important hint for `direct`
when deciding whether to keep, soften, or replace the existing motif.

## § Logo

```json
{
  "source": "inline-svg",          // one of: inline-svg | img | apple-touch-icon | og-image | favicon | synthesized
  "sourceSelector": "header svg",  // CSS selector or URL — null only for synthesized
  "localPath": "stardust/current/assets/logo.svg",
  "format": "svg",                 // svg | png | jpg | ico
  "intrinsicWidth": 180,
  "intrinsicHeight": 32,
  "synthesized": false,
  "synthesizedBasis": null         // e.g. "Brand initials EX, derived from page title"
}
```

Locator priority chain in `playwright-recipe.md` § Logo locator chain.
First hit wins.

## § Palette

Aggregated computed colors from across **all extracted pages** (see
§ Aggregation scope). Frequency-sorted, near-duplicates clustered,
role-named.

```json
[
  {
    "role": "background",
    "value": "#ffffff",
    "occurrences": 3421,           // pixels weighted by element area
    "sourceSelectors": ["body", ".container", ".hero"]
  },
  {
    "role": "text-primary",
    "value": "#0f1217",
    "occurrences": 894,
    "sourceSelectors": ["h1", "h2", "p"]
  },
  {
    "role": "primary",
    "value": "#147aff",
    "occurrences": 412,
    "sourceSelectors": [".btn-primary", "a"],
    "sources": ["home", "pricing", "donate"],
    "usedAs": ["background", "border", "fill"]
  },
  {
    "role": "surface",
    "value": "#f7f8fa",
    "occurrences": 280,
    "sourceSelectors": [".card", "section.alt"]
  },
  {
    "role": "border",
    "value": "#e5e7eb",
    "occurrences": 156,
    "sourceSelectors": [".card", "input"]
  }
]
```

Aggregation rules:

- **Discard non-colors before aggregation.** `rgba(*, 0)`,
  `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)`, the literal string `transparent`, and any
  CSS color whose alpha channel is 0 are not colors — they are
  "no color." If a section's `background-color` resolves to one
  of these, the section inherits its parent's effective background;
  the transparent value must not enter the palette aggregation.
  Picking up `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0)` as a `surface` role with high
  occurrence count (because most elements default to transparent
  backgrounds in CSS) is a real bug observed on
  theroadhome.org.
- Cluster colors within `ΔE < 5` (CIE76 in Lab space) and pick the
  most frequent member as the cluster representative.
- Pure `#000` and `#fff` are kept verbatim — do **not** silently tint
  them. Stardust's job here is descriptive, not corrective. The
  divergence toolkit (in `direct`) will flag pure black/white when
  the redesign target rejects them.
- Role names are heuristic: most-frequent background-color → `background`;
  most-frequent text color → `text-primary`; most-frequent
  background-color on `[role="button"]` and `.btn-*` → `primary`; etc.
  When a role can't be assigned, use `accent-N` with `N` ascending.
- Cap the palette at 8 entries. If the site uses more, keep the top 8
  by occurrences and record the dropped colors in `_provenance.notes`.
- Track **usage context** per color in `usedAs`: a deduped list drawn
  from `{ "background", "text", "border", "fill", "stroke", "outline" }`
  reflecting which CSS properties this color appeared as across the
  crawl. A color that appears only as `text` and never as
  `background`/`border`/`fill` is the signal the Tensions detector
  uses for color-imbalance flagging
  (`brand-review-template.md` § Detectors).

## § Type

```json
{
  "headingFamily": {
    "name": "Söhne",
    "stack": "\"Söhne\", system-ui, sans-serif",
    "weights": [400, 600, 700],
    "sizes": ["clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3.5rem)", "2.25rem", "1.75rem"],
    "lineHeights": [1.1, 1.15, 1.2],
    "letterSpacing": ["-0.02em", "-0.015em", "-0.01em"],
    "sourceSelectors": ["h1", "h2"]
  },
  "bodyFamily": {
    "name": "Inter",
    "stack": "\"Inter\", system-ui, sans-serif",
    "weights": [400, 500],
    "sizes": ["1rem", "0.9375rem", "0.8125rem"],
    "lineHeights": [1.5, 1.55, 1.4],
    "letterSpacing": ["normal"],
    "sourceSelectors": ["p", "li", "label"]
  },
  "monoFamily": null,
  "scaleRatio": 1.25,              // see § Modular-scale audit below; null if ad-hoc
  "scaleAudit": {
    "kind": "modular",             // "modular" | "ad-hoc"
    "ratios": [1.25, 1.25, 1.20],
    "matchedScale": "major-third"  // null when kind == "ad-hoc"
  },
  "loadStrategy": "swap",           // detected from font-display in @font-face rules
  "files": [                        // captured font files (per playwright-recipe.md § Capture list 16)
    {
      "url": "https://example.com/fonts/sohne-buch.woff2",
      "family": "Söhne",
      "weight": 400,
      "style": "normal",
      "unicodeRange": "U+0000-00FF",
      "localPath": "stardust/current/assets/fonts/sohne-buch.woff2",
      "sourceCssRule": "@font-face { font-family: 'Söhne'; src: url('/fonts/sohne-buch.woff2') format('woff2'); ... }",
      "licensingFlag": "private"     // null | "private" | "open"
    }
  ]
}
```

`files[]` is required when at least one captured page references
a `@font-face` rule. Empty array when the site uses only
system-stack fallbacks. `licensingFlag` defaults to `null`; set
to `"private"` when the family name does not appear in the
known-open-licence list (Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts free tier,
fontsource.org); `"open"` when it does. The flag is heuristic —
a `"private"` flag means *"verify before redeploying with
prototype output"*, not *"this font is non-free."*

Identify heading vs body by which family appears in the heading
outline (`pages/<slug>.json` § Headings) most often. If only one
family is in use, set both `headingFamily` and `bodyFamily` to it
with disjoint weights.

### Type-size aggregation

Per-level heading sizes are picked by **weighted score**, not
mode-of-frequency:

`score = pixelSize × (fontWeight / 400) × √count`

For each heading level present in the crawl, group captured headings
by `(fontSize, fontWeight)` tuple, compute the score per group, and
emit the top-scoring group's `fontSize` and `fontWeight` as that
level's representative.

Rationale: WordPress / SEO-plugin patterns ship hidden semantic H1s
on every page (e.g. `position: absolute; clip: rect(0 0 0 0)`).
Mode-of-size lets 20 hidden 18px H1s outweigh 2 visible 60px hero H1s
by raw count. The pixel-and-weight scoring biases toward the
visually-dominant variant — the display H1 is large *and* heavy *and*
repeated visibly across the site, so it always outranks accessibility
scaffolding under this rule.

This rule applies to per-level size selection in
`type.headingFamily.sizes[]`. Mode-of-frequency continues to apply
to motif aggregation (border-radius, shadow) per the rules in
§ Aggregation scope.

### Modular-scale audit

After heading sizes are collected, compute the ratio between every
consecutive pair (largest → smallest, in px). Compare each ratio to
the canonical scale set:

| name | ratio |
|---|---|
| minor-second | 1.067 |
| major-second | 1.125 |
| minor-third | 1.200 |
| major-third | 1.250 |
| perfect-fourth | 1.333 |
| augmented-fourth | 1.414 |
| perfect-fifth | 1.500 |
| golden | 1.618 |

If **every** observed ratio is within ±0.025 of the same canonical
ratio, set `scaleAudit.kind = "modular"`, `matchedScale = <name>`, and
`scaleRatio = <ratio>`.

Otherwise set `scaleAudit.kind = "ad-hoc"`, `matchedScale = null`,
`scaleRatio = null`, and list the observed ratios verbatim in
`scaleAudit.ratios`. Page-builder sites (Elementor, Webflow, Squarespace)
frequently end up here — large uneven jumps like 14 → 18 → 20 → 32 → 45 → 60.

`direct` reads `scaleAudit.kind` to decide whether the redesign target
should adopt a modular scale by default.

## § Spacing

```json
{
  "baseUnit": 4,                   // 4 | 8 — inferred from mode of paddings/gaps
  "scale": [4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96],
  "sectionPadding": "96px",
  "containerMaxWidth": "1280px",
  "gridGap": "24px"
}
```

If the existing site lacks rhythm (paddings are arbitrary, no
detectable scale), set `scale: []` and `baseUnit: null` — the
divergence toolkit will flag this in `direct`.

## § Motifs

Signature visual moves the existing site uses repeatedly.
`borderRadius`, `shadows`, and `gradients` are aggregated cross-page
per § Aggregation scope; `patterns` is observed where it occurs and
labelled with the page list in `evidence`.

```json
{
  "borderRadius": {
    "primary": "8px",              // mode of non-zero border-radii across all pages, weighted by element count
    "secondary": "16px",
    "pill": "9999px",
    "primarySources": ["home", "about", "stories"],
    "occurrences": { "8px": 122, "16px": 53, "9999px": 38, "2px": 30 }
  },
  "shadows": [
    { "value": "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)", "uses": "buttons" },
    { "value": "0 4px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)", "uses": "cards" },
    { "value": "0 24px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.12)", "uses": "modals" }
  ],
  "gradients": [
    { "value": "linear-gradient(135deg, #147aff 0%, #6b21ff 100%)", "uses": "hero-background" }
  ],
  "patterns": [
    { "name": "card-grid",         "evidence": "3 sections use 3-column repeat-cards" },
    { "name": "hero-with-image",   "evidence": "home hero uses split-half image+copy" },
    { "name": "social-proof-strip", "evidence": "logo strip after hero" }
  ]
}
```

Patterns is the open-ended one. Common values to watch for: `card-grid`,
`hero-with-image`, `hero-with-illustration`, `feature-3up`, `feature-list`,
`stat-row`, `pricing-3up`, `social-proof-logos`, `testimonial-carousel`,
`cta-band`, `footer-mega`, `nav-mega`. Add new pattern names freely;
this is descriptive.

## § Component style

The v1 fields, preserved so nothing is lost when DESIGN.json's
`extensions` block carries them forward.

```json
{
  "buttons": {
    "primary": {
      "background": "#147aff",
      "color": "#ffffff",
      "borderRadius": "8px",
      "padding": "12px 24px",
      "fontWeight": 600,
      "shadow": "0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)",
      "hoverDelta": "lighten 6%"
    },
    "secondary": { /* ... */ },
    "ghost": { /* ... */ }
  },
  "dualCTAPattern": "primary-then-secondary-link",  // observed if both appear together; null otherwise
  "cards": { "background": "#f7f8fa", "borderRadius": "12px", "padding": "24px", "shadow": null, "border": "1px solid #e5e7eb" },
  "inputs": { "borderRadius": "8px", "padding": "10px 12px", "border": "1px solid #d1d5db", "focusRing": "0 0 0 3px rgba(20,122,255,0.2)" }
}
```

## § System components

Cross-page repeated DOM blocks. These are almost always the most
load-bearing surfaces of the site (site header, site footer,
cross-promo strips, persistent CTAs, breadcrumbs). Missing them at
the brand-surface stage means `direct` cannot decide deliberately
whether to keep, move, or kill them — they silently disappear from
the redesign target.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "site-header",
    "kind": "header",                // header | footer | cross-promo | nav-secondary | sidebar | cta-band | breadcrumb | background-motif | other
    "occurrences": 12,                // pages where it appears (out of pages crawled)
    "headingSequence": ["About", "Stories", "Donate"],
    "ctaLabels": ["Donate now"],
    "domFingerprintHash": "sha256:...",
    "exampleSlug": "home",            // representative page; the verbatim block lives on this slug
    "exampleSelector": "header > nav.primary",
    "examplePages": ["home", "about", "stories"]
  }
]
```

Detection algorithm (heading-sequence diff, the cheap version that
captures ~80% of the value):

1. For each extracted page, build a fingerprint from each landmark:
   `(landmark tag, ordered list of immediate-child heading texts +
   CTA labels)`.
2. Group fingerprints across pages. Any fingerprint that appears on
   **≥ 3 pages** (or ≥ 50% of pages crawled, whichever is smaller — so
   small crawls still surface obvious system blocks) is a system
   component.
3. Classify with the `kind` heuristic:
   - landmark `header` / `[role="banner"]` → `header`
   - landmark `footer` / `[role="contentinfo"]` → `footer`
   - sequence contains 3+ navigation links + 1+ CTA on interior pages
     but not home → `cross-promo`
   - landmark `nav` not in header/footer → `nav-secondary`
   - landmark `aside` / `[role="complementary"]` → `sidebar`
   - large CTA-only block repeated above the footer → `cta-band`
   - ordered links matching `Home > Section > Page` → `breadcrumb`
   - else → `other`
4. Capture one verbatim example block (HTML serialised from
   `exampleSlug` at `exampleSelector`) so `direct` and `prototype` can
   reason about the actual content, not just the structure.

### Cross-page CSS-background reuse

Beyond DOM-fingerprint repeats, also detect **shared CSS background
images** across pages. A background image used on home AND on
about-us is almost always a system motif (a recurring banner, a
brand-photo treatment, a section ground) — not page-specific
content.

Algorithm:

1. Read every `pages/<slug>.json#media.cssBackgrounds[].url` across
   the crawl (after `playwright-recipe.md` capture step 11).
2. Group by URL (case-sensitive, full URL match).
3. For each URL appearing on **≥ 2 pages**, emit a system-component
   entry with `kind: "background-motif"`, `occurrences` = page
   count, `examplePages` = the page slugs.
4. The `exampleBlock` for a background-motif entry is the
   `domPath` + `boundingClientRect` + `backgroundSize` /
   `backgroundPosition` of one representative occurrence — enough
   for `direct` and `prototype` to reason about how the brand
   deploys the image.

This catches the case where a hero photo applied via
`background-image` is shared across multiple pages but invisible
to `<img>`-based capture. Without this aggregation, prototype
routinely places brand photos at the wrong section position
because it never saw them in the first place.

### Detection thresholds

When `pages crawled < 3`, skip detection and emit
`systemComponents: []` with a `_provenance.notes` line ("system
component detection requires ≥ 3 pages; crawl too small").

DOM-fingerprint diff (the thorough version) is out of scope for v0.2 —
file an issue if the heading-sequence version misses important blocks.

## § Icon font

When the site uses an icon font (per `playwright-recipe.md`
§ Capture list 17), capture the family name, the saved file, and
the `iconClass → codepoint` table so downstream `prototype` and
`migrate` can render the brand's actual icons rather than emoji
fallbacks.

```json
{
  "family": "panynj-icons",
  "localPath": "stardust/current/assets/fonts/panynj-icons.woff2",
  "sourceCss": "@font-face { font-family: 'panynj-icons'; src: url('/fonts/panynj-icons.woff2') format('woff2'); ... }",
  "glyphCount": 19,                // distinct icon classes captured (subset of the font's glyph table — only the ones the site actually uses)
  "glyphs": [
    { "class": "icon-search",       "codepoint": "\\E928", "name": "search" },
    { "class": "icon-accessible",   "codepoint": "\\E852", "name": "accessible" },
    { "class": "icon-arrow-right",  "codepoint": "\\E806", "name": "arrow-right" }
  ]
}
```

Set `iconFont: null` when no icon font is detected (the common
case for SVG-icon and inline-graphic sites). When detected, every
glyph the captured pages used appears in `glyphs[]`; glyphs the
font defines but the site doesn't deploy are out of scope.

`name` is a heuristic guess from the class suffix
(`icon-search` → `"search"`); leave `null` when the suffix is
opaque (`icon-i7`, `glyph-22`, etc.).

## § Voice

Sampled copy from the home page. Used by `direct` to reason about
tone moves and to seed the `voice.examples.do/dont` arrays in
DESIGN.json.

```json
{
  "heroHeadline": "Build, ship, and own your work",
  "heroSubcopy": "...",
  "heroImage": {
    "url": "https://example.com/img/hero-2-engineers-tablet.avif",
    "alt": "Two engineers reviewing a tablet at a standing desk",
    "source": "css-background",       // "img" | "css-background" | "css-pseudo-background" | null
    "domPath": "main > section.hero",
    "localPath": "stardust/current/assets/media/hero-a3f9.avif",
    "rect": { "x": 0, "y": 80, "width": 1440, "height": 720 }
  },
  "primaryCTALabel": "Start free trial",
  "ctaSamples": ["Start free trial", "Talk to sales", "See pricing", "Read the docs"],
  "navItems": ["Product", "Pricing", "Customers", "Docs", "Sign in"],
  "footerHeadings": ["Product", "Company", "Resources", "Legal"],
  "firstParagraph": "...",
  "tone": {
    "guess": "professional-warm",  // descriptive guess; one of: professional-warm | professional-formal | playful-bright | playful-dry | technical-precise | aspirational | bold-direct | other
    "evidence": "short sentences, second-person address, no jargon"
  }
}
```

### `heroImage` resolution

The hero photo is the home page's most load-bearing visual asset.
Without this field elevated, downstream `prototype` has to re-derive
"which captured image is the hero" from a noisy 16-image list every
render — and frequently picks the `og:image` (a curated thumbnail
optimised for social cards) instead of the actual visible hero. The
2026-05-04 ups.com home shipped the wrong hero on three variants
this way before the user noticed.

Resolve from the home page's captured media (both
`pages/home.json#media.images[]` and `media.cssBackgrounds[]` —
the second covers `background-image` and `::before` /
`::after` pseudo-element heroes per `playwright-recipe.md`
§ Capture list 11):

1. Filter to candidates with `rect.top < 800 px` (within the
   first viewport).
2. Filter to candidates with `rect.width × rect.height` ≥
   100 000 px² (excludes header logos, tiny chips, decorative
   columns).
3. Filter to candidates with `rect.aspectRatio` in `[0.3, 3.0]`
   — excludes thin banners and tall vertical strips.
4. Pick the candidate with the **largest visible area**. Tie-
   breaker: `<img>` over `cssBackgrounds[]` over
   `cssBackgrounds[]` with pseudo selector (slight preference
   for explicit DOM imagery, which downstream consumers can
   manipulate more reliably).

Set `source` to `"img"`, `"css-background"`, or
`"css-pseudo-background"` based on which capture produced the
winner. When no candidate survives the filters, set `heroImage:
null` and surface in `_provenance.notes` (most non-marketing
pages — search, 404, login — legitimately have no hero).

Downstream `prototype` reads `heroImage.url` /
`heroImage.localPath` directly when composing the hero slot
under Mode A's image-reuse contract (per
`skills/direct/SKILL.md` § Mode A).

The `tone.guess` is a heuristic — never present it as ground truth in
the user report. `direct` will use it as one of several signals, not
as a fact.

## § Voice table

Cross-page aggregations that fuel the brand-review's data tables. The
`voice` block above samples the home page; `voiceTable` aggregates
across **all extracted pages** so the review can show frequency, not
just examples.

```json
{
  "ctaFrequency": [
    { "label": "Donate", "total": 35, "pageCount": 10, "pages": ["home", "about-us", ...] },
    { "label": "Read More", "total": 56, "pageCount": 5, "pages": [...] }
  ],
  "headingFrequency": [
    { "text": "Looking for immediate shelter?", "total": 22, "pageCount": 10, "level": 2 },
    { "text": "Get Involved",                   "total": 11, "pageCount": 9,  "level": 3 }
  ],
  "toneMetrics": {
    "headingsTotal": 312,
    "headingsUppercasePercent": 44,
    "distinctHeadings": 153,
    "distinctCtaLabels": 40
  }
}
```

Aggregation rules:

- `ctaFrequency` — built from every `pages/*.json#ctas[].label`. To
  catch styled `<a>` links the visual-button heuristic missed (e.g.
  WordPress sites that style links as buttons via classes), also
  include link texts that match the closed list below. Match is
  case-insensitive after trimming whitespace; full-string equality

  These mirror and slightly expand the CTA equivalence buckets in
  `brand-review-template.md § CTA equivalence buckets`; the buckets
  drive the `T-cta-vocab` Tensions detector, while this list drives
  the `voiceTable.ctaFrequency` aggregation.

  Sort by `total` descending; on ties, sort by `pageCount` descending.
  Cap retained list at 8 entries; the rest are dropped (the
  brand-review table renders the top 8).

  **Closed list.** The list is exhaustive for v0.2; do not extend at
  runtime. When a real run surfaces a missing CTA verb worth
  catching, add it here in spec, not in the renderer. Fuzzy /
  edit-distance matching is tracked as a v0.3 issue
  (`brand-review-template.md § Open issues for v0.3`).
- `headingFrequency` — built from every `pages/*.json#headings[].text`.
  Filter to entries with `pageCount >= 3`. Sort by `total`, then
  `pageCount`. This is the strongest signal of repeated site-wide
  blocks (e.g. a "Looking for immediate shelter?" cross-promo).
- `toneMetrics.headingsUppercasePercent` — fraction of headings whose
  text equals its uppercase form. The brand-review uses
  `≥ 25` as the threshold to apply `text-transform: uppercase` to
  H1/H2/H3 in the review chrome.
- `toneMetrics.distinctHeadings` and `distinctCtaLabels` — set sizes
  across all pages. High distinct-CTA counts (>20) often signal
  vocabulary fragmentation; the Tensions detector
  (`brand-review-template.md § Detectors`, `T-cta-vocab`) consumes
  this.

## § Cross-promo

A cluster of repeated headings + CTAs that appears on most interior
pages. Almost always the most load-bearing site-wide repeated block
(call-to-action band, footer cross-promo, "looking for X?" panel).
Detection runs **after** `headingFrequency` is built.

```json
{
  "detected": true,
  "anchorHeading": "Looking for immediate shelter?",
  "cluster": [
    { "text": "Looking for immediate shelter?",  "total": 22, "pageCount": 10, "overlap": 10 },
    { "text": "Experiencing a housing crisis?",  "total": 12, "pageCount": 10, "overlap": 9  },
    { "text": "Please call: 211",                "total": 11, "pageCount": 10, "overlap": 9  }
  ],
  "pages": ["about-us", "donate", "events", ...],
  "pageCount": 10,
  "totalPages": 24
}
```

Detection algorithm:

1. Take the most-frequent entry in `headingFrequency` as the anchor.
2. Find all pages whose headings include the anchor text — call this
   the anchor-page set.
3. For each top-12 entry in `headingFrequency`, count how many
   anchor-pages also contain it (`overlap`). Keep entries where
   `overlap / anchorPages.size >= 0.6`.
4. If the resulting cluster has ≥ 2 entries, emit a cross-promo
   record.

When detected, the brand-review **must** render a cross-promo
reproduction section (`brand-review-template.md § Section ordering →
Cross-promo reproduction`). Set `detected: false` and emit `null` for
the rest when no cluster meets the threshold.

## § Embed-dominated pages

After Phase 2, scan each page's `embedDominance` field
(`current-state-schema.md` § Embed dominance). If any page has
`dominated: true`, add a section to the generated DESIGN.md (and
mention in the user report) labeled "Third-party embeds (opaque to
extraction)" that lists the affected slugs and embed sources. The
brand-surface tokens for those pages are not captured in computed
styles — the screenshot is the only artifact `direct` and `prototype`
can reason from.

Do **not** attempt recursive extraction of the iframe `src` URL in
v0.2; that's tracked as a separate feature.

## § Register

```json
"register": "brand"
```

One of `brand`, `product`, `ambiguous`. Heuristic:

- `brand` if landing-page indicators dominate: hero with marketing
  copy, social proof, pricing, signup CTA above the fold, no
  authentication required to see the page.
- `product` if tool indicators dominate: data tables, navigation
  optimized for known features, requires auth, contains widgets like
  filters and sort.
- `ambiguous` if both appear or neither dominates. Stardust will ask
  the user in `direct` rather than guess.

---

## What this file is **not**

- A definition of what the brand should be. That's the *target*
  PRODUCT.md and DESIGN.md, written by `direct`.
- A critique. No judgement, no scores. `critique` belongs to
  impeccable.
- A migration spec. The brand surface describes; it does not
  prescribe.
