# MCP Tool Orchestration (Core Surface)

Use this map to sequence current Dispatcher MCP tools.

## Tool Purpose Map

- `validate`: syntax/structure validation for dispatcher/httpd/cloud/runtime config checks.
- `lint`: security/performance/best-practice analysis.
- `sdk`: file integrity, baseline drift, and SDK-backed validation/runtime checks.
- `trace_request`: request-stage evidence (filter, cache, log context). Can be driven by **URL** or by **pid:tid** from `tail_logs` (see “Trace by pid:tid” below).
- `inspect_cache`: cache object/path evidence.
- `monitor_metrics`: aggregated runtime signals.
- `tail_logs`: direct log evidence. Entries from dispatcher debug/error logs may include **pid** and **tid** for use with `trace_request(pid=..., tid=...)`.

## Recommended Sequences

### Config Authoring / Refactor

1. Edit config files
2. `validate`
3. `lint`
4. `sdk(action="check-files")`
5. `sdk(action="diff-baseline")` when drift matters
6. runtime tools if behavior requires runtime proof

### Incident / Regression Analysis

1. `trace_request` (by URL and/or by pid:tid)
2. `tail_logs`
3. `inspect_cache`
4. `monitor_metrics`
5. `validate` + `lint`
6. `sdk` checks if file integrity is suspect

### Trace by pid:tid (tail_logs → trace_request)

When you need the full log trace for a specific request:

1. Call **`tail_logs`** (e.g. `lines=50` or with `filter_url`). Some entries will include **`pid`** and **`tid`** when the log line contains `[pid X:tid Y]` (dispatcher debug/error logs).
2. From the returned **entries**, take **pid** and **tid** from any entry that has them.
3. Call **`trace_request(pid=..., tid=...)`** to get all log lines for that process/thread in the **log_analysis** stage (filter and cache stages are skipped when no URL is provided).

Use this when tracing a request that appears in `tail_logs` and you want the full dispatcher debug sequence for that request. Requires MCP server built from aem-dispatcher-mcp that supports `trace_request` with optional **pid** and **tid**.

### Release Readiness Review

1. `validate`
2. `lint`
3. `sdk(action="check-files")`
4. `sdk(action="diff-baseline")`
5. Optional: `sdk(action="validate-full")` / `sdk(action="docker-test")` if environment supports it

## Fallback Rules

- If runtime preconditions are missing, continue with static checks and report missing evidence.
- If SDK actions requiring external binaries/runtime fail due environment, run available checks and report limits.
- Never report simulated success for unexecuted checks.

## Tool Usage Notes

- **`lint` with `mode=directory`:** The `target` path is resolved from the MCP server's working directory, not necessarily the editor workspace. If the server returns "Directory not found", the server may not have filesystem access to the given path. Fallback: run `validate` with the relevant config content (e.g. filter snippet and `config_type: filter`), or run lint from an environment where the MCP server can read the dispatcher config directory (e.g. SDK container, CI with correct cwd).
- **`validate`:** Accepts inline config content; use for single-file or snippet validation when directory-based lint is unavailable.

## Precision Invocation Profiles

Use these profiles to improve deterministic output quality without expanding tool scope.

### Filter Edits

1. `validate({"config":"<filter section content>","type":"dispatcher","config_type":"filter"})`
2. `lint({"mode":"config","target":"<filter section content>","analysis_depth":"deep"})`
3. `sdk({"action":"check-files","config_path":"<dispatcher src path>"})` when file-level drift matters

Expected gain:
- catches filter ordering/shadow issues early
- improves confidence for last-match-wins behavior

### Rewrite/Vhost Edits

1. `validate({"config":"<vhost/rewrite block>","type":"httpd","config_type":"vhost"})` for Apache blocks
2. `validate({"config":"<dispatcher.any section>","type":"dispatcher","config_type":"dispatcher.any"})` for dispatcher blocks
3. `lint({"mode":"config","target":"<merged dispatcher content>","analysis_depth":"standard"})`

Expected gain:
- separates Apache syntax issues from Dispatcher syntax issues
- reduces mixed-surface false conclusions

### Cache/Invalidation Edits

1. `validate({"config":"<cache section content>","type":"dispatcher","config_type":"cache"})`
2. `lint({"mode":"config","target":"<cache section content>","analysis_depth":"deep"})`
3. `trace_request({"url":"<cache-hit candidate url>"})` + `inspect_cache({"url":"<cache-hit candidate url>"})`, then repeat for one cache-bypass candidate

Expected gain:
- validates both static correctness and runtime behavior evidence

### Clientheaders / Host Contract Edits

1. `validate({"config":"<farm or clientheaders content>","type":"dispatcher"})`
2. `lint({"mode":"config","target":"<farm or clientheaders content>","analysis_depth":"standard"})`
3. `sdk({"action":"check-files","config_path":"<dispatcher src path>"})`
4. `trace_request({"url":"<feature url affected by forwarded headers>"})`

Expected gain:
- catches wrapper drift around `default_clientheaders.any`
- forces feature-level verification for auth/host/protocol regressions
